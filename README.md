# 🐍 Python Mastery Roadmap (Fundamentals → OOP → DSA)

This repository contains a **complete, structured Python learning roadmap** designed to take a **true beginner** to **strong real-world Python competency**, including **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

This is **not a tutorial dump**.  
Every topic is backed by **real-world practice tasks**, **clean Python code**, and **clear explanations**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Build **solid Python fundamentals**
- Write **readable, maintainable, and efficient code**
- Understand **OOP design correctly (Pythonic, not Java-style)**
- Master **DSA concepts required for interviews**
- Maintain a **strong GitHub proof of learning**

❌ Web frameworks, databases, APIs, and deployment are intentionally excluded.  
✅ Focus is strictly on **Python + DSA mastery**.

---

## 👨‍💻 Who This Is For

- Beginners learning Python from scratch  
- Students preparing for **technical interviews**
- Freshers building **portfolio-ready GitHub repositories**
- Anyone tired of random tutorials and wants **structured learning**

---

## How to Use This Repository

- Each folder = **one main concept**
- Folder names follow the roadmap order
- Every folder must contain:
  - Python code (`.py`)
  - A `README.md` explaining:
    - What the concept is
    - Why it matters
    - How your code works
    - Time & space complexity where applicable
- You move forward **only after**:
  - Writing code without copy-pasting
  - Explaining your solution clearly in README
  - Handling edge cases

If you cannot explain it, you do not know it.

## 📂 Recommended Repository Structure

```

python-mastery-roadmap/
│
├── fundamentals/
├── intermediate/
├── oop/
├── dsa/
│
└── README.md

```

Each topic folder:
```

topic-name/
├── solution.py
└── README.md
```

---

## Rules You Must Follow

- ❌ No copy-pasting solutions without understanding
- ❌ No skipping README explanations
- ❌ No “I’ll come back later”
- ✅ Write clean, readable code
- ✅ Refactor when you learn something better
- ✅ Measure time/space complexity for DSA

---

## DSA Expectations (Be Honest With Yourself)

You are expected to:
- Understand **why** a solution works
- Know **time and space complexity**
- Choose the **right data structure**
- Avoid brute force unless justified

If your solution only works for small inputs, it’s wrong.

---

## Completion Criteria

You are “done” only when:
- You can explain every folder **without notes**
- You can rebuild the projects from scratch
- You can solve unseen problems using learned patterns
- Your README files are clear enough for a stranger to learn from

---

## 🚀 Final Outcome

By completing this repository, you will have:

✔ Strong Python fundamentals  
✔ Clean and Pythonic OOP understanding  
✔ Interview-ready DSA skills  
✔ A professional GitHub repository that proves real competence

**Happy Coding 🐍**
